- What is a Linked List?
- Linear Data Structure
- Linked List vs Arrays
- Components of Linked List
- Head,Node,Tail
- Types of Linked List:
    * Single Linked List;
    * Circular Single Linked List;
    * Double Linked List;
    * Circular Double Linked List;
- Representation in Memory 
- Common operations of Linked List
    
- Creating a Single Linked List :
    * create a head,tail and initialize with null;
    * create a blank node;
    * node.value = nodeValue;
    * node.next = null;
    * head = node;
    * tail = node
- Time Complexity - O(1) and Space Complexity O(1)
- Insertion in SLL
